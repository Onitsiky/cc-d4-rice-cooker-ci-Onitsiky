# Ruby implementation of My Rice Cooker

Here you can find the implementation of __My Rice Cooker__ using __Ruby__.

## Requirements :computer:

On your machine you will have to install and setup ruby environment. You can refer to this [documentation](https://www.ruby-lang.org/fr/documentation/installation/) for installation.

## Installation :hammer_and_wrench:
Clone this repository in your local machine:
```shell
    git clone https://github.com/hei-school/cc-d2-my-rice-cooker-Onitsiky.git
```

Checkout into the __feature/ruby__ branch:
```shell
    cd cc-d2-my-rice-cooker-Onitsiky/
    git checkout origin/feature/ruby
```

## Running the application :flight_departure:

To run the application, just enter the following command: 
```sheel
    ruby ./src/feature/main_menu.rb
```

## Bug :bug:
When leaving the application, it doesn't directly leave but still loop on the menu. 

## Linter
As linter, I used __rubocop__ .

You can install rubocop [here](https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/1.58/installation.html), and to check, just run:
```shell
    rubocop
```
